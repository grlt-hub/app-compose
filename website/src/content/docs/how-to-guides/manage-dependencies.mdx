In this guide, we’ll look at how to manage dependencies between containers using the `dependsOn` and `optionalDependsOn` options. Defining dependencies allows you to control the order in which containers start, ensuring that necessary data or functionality is available when each container initializes.

We’ll explore:

- `dependsOn`: Strict dependencies that must be initialized before the container starts.
- `optionalDependsOn`: Flexible dependencies that are used if available but are not required.
- how to access dependencies

By configuring these dependencies, you can create modular and interdependent components that execute in the correct order and adapt based on available data.

## Strict Dependency (`dependsOn`)

When a container has a strict dependency defined by `dependsOn`, it relies on the successful initialization of that dependency to start. Here’s how `dependsOn` affects container statuses:

- **If the dependency is** `done`: The container will proceed to start, as all strict dependencies have completed successfully.
- **If the dependency is** `fail`: If a container’s dependency is in the `fail` status, the dependent container will also `fail`. This strict relationship ensures that any error in a required dependency is propagated to dependent containers.
  - Example: If `Container A` depends on `Container B` via `dependsOn` and `Container B` has a `fail` status, then `Container A` will also be marked as `fail`.
- **If the dependency is** `off`: If the dependency is in the `off` status (disabled), then the dependent container will also be marked as `off`. This prevents the container from running if a required dependency is explicitly turned off.
  - Example: If `Container C` depends on `Container D` via `dependsOn` and `Container D` is `off`, then `Container C` will also be `off`.

## Optional Dependency (`optionalDependsOn`)

The `optionalDependsOn` option allows you to define dependencies that are not strictly required for the container to start. This means the container will attempt to start regardless of the final status of these dependencies. Here’s how `optionalDependsOn` affects container statuses:

- **If the dependency is** `done`: The container will start and use any data or resources provided by the `optionalDependsOn` dependency.
  - **Example**: If `Container E` optionally depends on `Container F`, and `Container F` is `done`, then `Container E` will start and can access `Container F`'s data.
- **If the dependency is** `fail`: The container will still attempt to start even if the optional dependency fails. This flexibility allows the container to function independently without failing due to non-critical errors.
  - **Example**: If `Container G` optionally depends on `Container H`, and `Container H` has a `fail` status, then `Container G` will still try to start without data from `Container H`.
- **If the dependency is** `off`: Similar to a `fail` status, the container will still attempt to start without the optional dependency. This enables the container to run without being affected by dependencies that are explicitly turned off.
  - **Example**: If `Container I` optionally depends on `Container J`, and `Container J` is `off`, then `Container I` will start as usual.

Using `optionalDependsOn` provides flexibility, allowing containers to run even when some dependencies are unavailable. This approach is useful for non-critical dependencies, where the container can perform its primary function regardless of the state of these optional dependencies.

## Accessing Dependencies

```ts
type StartFn = (dependsOn, optionalDependsOn) => Promise<StartResult> | StartResult;
type EnableFn = (dependsOn, optionalDependsOn) => Promise<boolean> | boolean;
```

In both the `start` and `enable` functions, you can access dependencies and optional dependencies through the function parameters:

- **Strict Dependencies** (`dependsOn`) are accessible as the first parameter in `start` and `enable`. This provides the APIs of all required dependencies that have been resolved.
- **Optional Dependencies** (`optionalDependsOn`) are available as the second parameter in `start` and `enable`. These are accessible if the optional dependencies are resolved, but the container can still start if they are unavailable.

By using these parameters, you can conditionally access dependency data as needed, allowing your containers to respond flexibly to the availability of required and optional dependencies.

## Examples

### Example 1: Using `dependsOn` for _Strict Dependencies_

In this example, we set up two containers, where one (`accountContainer`) depends on the other (`userContainer`). The `accountContainer` will not start until the `userContainer` has successfully completed.

```ts
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const userContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'user',
  start: () => {
    console.log('User data loaded');
    return { api: { userId: 'user123' } };
  },
});

const accountContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'account',
  dependsOn: [userContainer],
  start: (depsApi) => {
    console.log('Account loaded for user:', depsApi.user.userId);
    return { api: {} };
  },
});

await compose.up([userContainer, accountContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

In this example, `accountContainer` can access data from `userContainer`, as it waits for `userContainer` to complete:

```sh
User data loaded
Account loaded for user: user123
```

### Example 2: Using `optionalDependsOn` for _Flexible Dependencies_

In this example, `notificationContainer` has an optional dependency on `userContainer`. If `userContainer` completes successfully, `notificationContainer` can access user data. If `userContainer` does not complete or is turned off, `notificationContainer` will still start but without user data.

```ts
const notificationContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'notification',
  optionalDependsOn: [userContainer],
  start: (_, optionalDepsApi) => {
    if (optionalDepsApi.user) {
      console.log('Notifications loaded for user:', optionalDepsApi.user.userId);
    } else {
      console.log('Notifications loaded without user context');
    }
    return { api: {} };
  },
});

await compose.up([userContainer, notificationContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

If `userContainer` completes successfully, `notificationContainer` will access `userId`. If `userContainer` is unavailable, `notificationContainer` will start independently:

```sh
User data loaded
Notifications loaded for user: user123
```

or, if `userContainer` is unavailable:

```sh
Notifications loaded without user context
```

### Example 3: Using _Both_ `dependsOn` and `optionalDependsOn`

In this example, `dashboardContainer` depends on `settingsContainer` as a strict dependency and on `userContainer` as an optional dependency. It will only start after `settingsContainer` completes but can use `userContainer` if available.

```ts
const settingsContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'settings',
  start: () => {
    console.log('Settings loaded');
    return { api: { theme: 'dark' } };
  },
});

const dashboardContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'dashboard',
  dependsOn: [settingsContainer],
  optionalDependsOn: [userContainer],
  start: (depsApi, optionalDepsApi) => {
    console.log('Dashboard started with settings:', depsApi.settings.theme);
    if (optionalDepsApi.user) {
      console.log('Dashboard has user context:', optionalDepsApi.user.userId);
    }
    return { api: {} };
  },
});

await compose.up([settingsContainer, userContainer, dashboardContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

If both `settingsContainer` and `userContainer` complete successfully, `dashboardContainer` will receive data from both:

```sh
Settings loaded
User data loaded
Dashboard started with settings: dark
Dashboard has user context: user123
```

If `userContainer` is unavailable, `dashboardContainer` will still start with `settingsContainer`:

```sh
Settings loaded
Dashboard started with settings: dark
```

## Summary

In this guide, we explored how to use `dependsOn` and `optionalDependsOn` to manage container dependencies. Key takeaways include:

- **Strict Dependencies** (`dependsOn`): Containers with strict dependencies only start once all required dependencies have reached a `done` status. If any strict dependency is `off`, the container will also be set to `off`. If a strict dependency fails, the container will inherit the `fail` status.
- **Optional Dependencies** (`optionalDependsOn`): Containers with optional dependencies attempt to start regardless of the status of those dependencies. If optional dependencies are available, the container can access their data; if not, it will still function independently.
- **Accessing Dependencies**: In `start` and `enable`, dependencies and optional dependencies are accessible as the first and second parameters, respectively. This allows containers to flexibly retrieve data based on both strict and optional dependencies.

By configuring strict and optional dependencies, you can control the order and conditions under which containers start, creating modular and interdependent components. This setup ensures that containers have access to the necessary resources and data, improving both flexibility and reliability.
