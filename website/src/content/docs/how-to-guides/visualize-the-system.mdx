In this section, you will learn how to visualize the system of containers in `app-compose`.<br />
Visualization helps you see how containers are connected, their dependencies, and their current statuses.

You can use the `graph` command to generate a visual representation of your container structure. This makes it easier to understand complex systems and debug issues.

## Example

```ts {14}
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const start = () => ({ api: null });

const a = createContainer({ id: 'a', domain: 'a', start });
const b = createContainer({ id: 'b', domain: 'b', dependencies: [a], start });
const c = createContainer({ id: 'c', domain: 'c', optionalDependencies: [b], start });
const d = createContainer({ id: 'd', domain: 'd', dependencies: [c], optionalDependencies: [b], start });

const cmd = await compose({
  stages: [['_', [a, b, c, d]]],
});

const { graph, dependsOn, requiredBy } = await cmd.graph();

console.log(JSON.stringify(graph, undefined, 2));
```

The `cmd.graph` command returns an object with:

- `graph` — the visual representation of the system.
- `dependsOn`(Container[]) — shows which containers the specified container depends on.
- `requiredBy`(Container[]) — shows which containers require the specified container to work.

The output provides a detailed breakdown of each container:

- **Direct Dependencies**:
  - **Strict**: Lists containers that are `strict` dependencies of the current container.
  - **Optional**: Lists containers that are `optional` dependencies of the current container.
- **Transitive Dependencies**:
  - **Strict**: Lists containers that are `strict` dependencies, inherited through a chain of dependencies.
  - **Optional**: Lists containers that are `optional` dependencies, inherited through a chain of dependencies.
- **Transitive Dependency Paths**:
  - Each transitive dependency includes a path that describes how the dependency is reached, which is helpful for tracing and debugging.

```json
{
  "a": {
    "domain": "a",
    "dependencies": [],
    "optionalDependencies": [],
    "transitive": {
      "dependencies": [],
      "optionalDependencies": []
    }
  },
  "b": {
    "domain": "b",
    "dependencies": ["a"],
    "optionalDependencies": [],
    "transitive": {
      "dependencies": [],
      "optionalDependencies": []
    }
  },
  "c": {
    "domain": "c",
    "dependencies": [],
    "optionalDependencies": ["b"],
    "transitive": {
      "dependencies": [],
      "optionalDependencies": [
        {
          "id": "a",
          "path": "c -> b -> a"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "d": {
    "domain": "d",
    "dependencies": ["c"],
    "optionalDependencies": ["b"],
    "transitive": {
      "dependencies": [],
      "optionalDependencies": [
        {
          "id": "a",
          "path": "d -> b -> a"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Grouping by Domain

If you want to collapse the view to show only domains, you can pass an option:

```ts
const { graph, dependsOn, requiredBy } = await cmd.graph({ view: 'domains' });
```

## When to Use `compose.graph`

- **Debugging**: Use the graph output to identify and resolve potential issues, such as missing or transitive (hidden) dependencies.
- **Optimizing Architecture**: Analyze the dependency structure to refactor and optimize your application's architecture.
- **Documenting Dependencies**: Generate a visual representation to document the architecture for your team.
