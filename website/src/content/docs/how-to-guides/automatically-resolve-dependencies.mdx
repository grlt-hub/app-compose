By default, `compose.up` expects a list of all containers that should be initialized. This approach requires manual effort but ensures that the result of `compose.up` is explicit and predictable. However, managing this manually can be inconvenient and cumbersome, especially in large applications. To simplify this, `app-compose` offers an option for automatic dependency resolution, allowing you to omit many containers from the input list of `compose.up`or `compose.graph`.

## Description of `autoResolveDeps`

The `autoResolveDeps` option provides an easy way to automatically resolve container dependencies. It has the following properties:

- **strict** (`true`): This is a required property. When set to true, all strict dependencies (`dependsOn`) are automatically resolved, ensuring that containers with required dependencies are initialized properly without the need to manually list them in `compose.up`.
- **optional** (`boolean`, optional): This property controls whether optional dependencies (`optionalDependsOn`) should also be resolved automatically. If set to `true`, both strict and optional dependencies will be resolved. If omitted or set to `false`, only strict dependencies will be automatically resolved.

## Advantages

- `autoResolveDeps` simplifies dependency management by resolving dependencies automatically.
- Reduces the need to manually list every container in `compose.up` or `compose.graph`.
- Makes your code cleaner and more maintainable.
- Minimizes the risk of errors in large dependency graphs.
- Works for both strict (`dependsOn`) and optional (`optionalDependsOn`) dependencies.
- Useful for both initializing containers (`compose.up`) and visualizing dependencies (`compose.graph`).

## Example

### Before

```ts
import { compose, createContainer } from 'app-compose';

const userEntity = createContainer({
  id: 'userEntity',
  api: () => ({ api: null }),
});

const settingsEntity = createContainer({
  id: 'settingsEntity',
  dependsOn: [userEntity],
  api: () => ({ api: null }),
});

const myAwesomeFeature = createContainer({
  id: 'myAwesomeFeature',
  dependsOn: [userEntity, settingsEntity],
  api: () => ({ api: null }),
});

compose.up([userEntity, settingsEntity, myAwesomeFeature]);
```

In this case, all containers must be explicitly listed, which becomes cumbersome as the number of dependencies grows.

### After

```ts {20}
import { compose, createContainer } from 'app-compose';

const userEntity = createContainer({
  id: 'userEntity',
  api: () => ({ api: null }),
});

const settingsEntity = createContainer({
  id: 'settingsEntity',
  dependsOn: [userEntity],
  api: () => ({ api: null }),
});

const myAwesomeFeature = createContainer({
  id: 'myAwesomeFeature',
  dependsOn: [userEntity, settingsEntity],
  api: () => ({ api: null }),
});

compose.up([myAwesomeFeature], { autoResolveDeps: { strict: true, optional: true } });
```

Here, only `myAwesomeFeature` needs to be provided. `compose.up` will automatically resolve and include `userEntity` and `settingsEntity` as dependencies, significantly reducing the manual effort required to maintain the list of containers.

This feature not only simplifies the initialization process but also makes your code cleaner and easier to manage, especially as your dependency graph evolves.
