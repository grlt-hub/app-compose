In this section, you will learn how to define which containers are critical for your app to start successfully.<br />
You can use the `required` option in `compose.up` to control the startup process and handle critical parts of your app effectively.

## Values

- `required: undefined`: The app will start even if some containers do not work. This is the **default** value.
- `required: 'all'`: All containers must start. If one container fails, up will stop and reject an error.
- `required: [container1, container2]`: Only the listed containers must start successfully. If one of them fails, up will reject.
- `required: [container1, [container2, container3]`: Nested lists mean that at least one container from the group must start.<br />
  In this example, `container1` and either `container2` or `container3` must start successfully.

### Example

```tsx {6}
const cmd = await compose({
  stages: [
    ['prepare', [chef, ingredients]],
    ['cooking', [pizza]],
  ],
  required: 'all',
});
```
