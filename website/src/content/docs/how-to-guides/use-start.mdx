The `start` function in each container defines its initialization logic. Whether you’re loading data, setting up configurations, or performing calculations, `start` manages the container's setup when it’s ready to launch. In this guide, we’ll cover:

We’ll explore:

- **Synchronous and Asynchronous Execution**: How to use `start` for both synchronous and asynchronous tasks.
- **Return Value**: The structure of the object returned by `start`, including the `api` key.

Using `start` effectively allows containers to initialize with necessary data and handle any required asynchronous operations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Synchronous Execution in `start`

For simple tasks that don’t involve asynchronous operations, `start` can be used synchronously. Here’s an example of a container that initializes with basic configuration data:

```ts
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const configContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'config',
  start: () => {
    console.log('Configuration loaded');
    return { api: { theme: 'dark' } };
  },
});

await compose.up([dataContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

The `configContainer` initializes and logs its status:

```sh
Configuration loaded
```

### Example 2: Asynchronous Execution in `start`

If `start` needs to perform asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from an API, you can make it asynchronous by defining it as an `async` function. Here’s an example:

```ts
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const dataContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'data',
  start: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data loaded:', data);
    return { api: { data } };
  },
});

await compose.up([dataContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

The `dataContainer` waits until the data is loaded and then completes its initialization:

```sh
Data loaded: { ... }
```

### Example 3: Return Value of `start`

The `start` function should always return an object with an `api` key, which provides data or functions that might be needed elsewhere in the application. Here’s an example of how to structure this return value:

```ts
const settingsContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'settings',
  start: () => {
    return { api: { setting1: true, setting2: 'value' } };
  },
});
```

#### Expected Result

In this example, `settingsContainer` returns configuration settings within the `api` key, making them available for use.

```sh
{ setting1: true, setting2: 'value' }
```

## Summary

In this guide, we explored how to use the `start` function to initialize containers. Key takeaways include:

- **Synchronous and Asynchronous Execution**: `start` can handle both simple, synchronous tasks and more complex asynchronous operations, such as data fetching. To execute asynchronous tasks, simply define `start` as an `async` function.
- **Return Value**: The `start` function should always return an object containing an `api` key. This `api` key provides data or functionality that may be needed elsewhere in the application, helping to maintain a consistent structure across containers.

By effectively using `start`, you can set up containers with the required data and manage initialization processes, whether they are synchronous or asynchronous.
