In the previous examples, we’ve already seen `stages`. Now it’s time to explain what they are and how they work.

Stages are useful when you need to **control** the priority of starting containers.<br />
In real applications, some things are more important, and some are less important.

It’s a good idea to **load and start important things first**, and then start the less important ones.<br />
This helps your app start in the right priority and feel better for the user.

Each stage has a name and a list of containers to start. The stages run in order, so you can decide which containers start first and which start next.

## Analogy from Cooking

Imagine you’re preparing a meal. You need to make **the main course** and **dessert**.

It’s important to start with the main course because it takes more time to cook and people are usually hungry for it first.<br />
Once the main course is ready, you can start making the dessert.

## Example

```tsx
import { compose, createContainer } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const mainCource = createContainer({
  id: 'pizza',
  domain: 'dish',
  start: () => {
    console.log('pizza is ready');

    return { api: { value: 'pizza' } };
  },
});

const dessert = createContainer({
  id: 'dessert',
  domain: 'dish',
  start: () => {
    console.log('dessert is ready');

    return { api: { value: 'dessert' } };
  },
});

const { up } = await compose({
  stages: [
    // This stage runs first.
    // The main course (pizza) will start here.
    ['first', [mainCource]],
    // This stage runs after the first.
    // The dessert will start only when the first stage is done.
    ['then', [dessert]],
  ],
});

up();
```

When you run this code, you should see the following output in the console:

```sh
> npm start
pizza is ready
dessert is ready
```
