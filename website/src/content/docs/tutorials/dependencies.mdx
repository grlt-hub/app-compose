In real applications, containers often need to work together. Some containers depend on others to perform their tasks. For this, we use `dependencies` and `optionalDependencies`.

- **dependencies** are containers that must be available for another container to start. If such a dependency is missing or not working, the container won’t start.

- **optionalDependencies** are containers that can be used if available, but their absence won’t prevent the container from starting.

In this section, we’ll show how to connect containers using `dependencies` and `optionalDependencies`. You’ll see how one container can use data or functionality from another.

## Analogy from Cooking

Imagine you are making a pizza.

- You need dough, sauce, and cheese — without them, you can’t make a pizza. These are your required dependencies (`dependencies`).
- But olives are an optional dependency (`optionalDependencies`). They add extra flavor, but if you don’t have them, you’ll still have a delicious pizza.

It’s the same with containers: some things are needed to make them work, and others just make them better.

## Example

```ts
import { compose, createContainer } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const dough = createContainer({
  id: 'dough',
  domain: 'ingredients',
  start: () => ({ api: { value: 'dough' } }),
});

const sauce = createContainer({
  id: 'sauce',
  domain: 'ingredients',
  start: () => ({ api: { value: 'sauce' } }),
});

const cheese = createContainer({
  id: 'cheese',
  domain: 'ingredients',
  start: () => ({ api: { value: 'cheese' } }),
});

const olives = createContainer({
  id: 'olives',
  domain: 'ingredients',
  start: () => ({ api: { value: 'olives' } }),
});

const pizza = createContainer({
  id: 'pizza',
  domain: 'dish',

  // Required dependencies: pizza cannot be made without dough, sauce, and cheese
  dependencies: [dough, sauce, cheese],

  // Optional dependency: olives, but pizza can be made without them
  optionalDependencies: [olives],

  // Start function: combines all available ingredients into a pizza
  start: (api) => {
    const ingredients = Object.values(api).map((x) => x.value);

    console.log(`${ingredients.join(' + ')} = pizza`);

    return { api: { data: 'pizza' } };
  },
});

const { up } = await compose({
  stages: [['prepare', [pizza]]],
});

up();
```

When you run this code, you should see the following output in the console:

```sh
dough + sauce + cheese = pizza
```

## Why Olives Are Missing?

In the last example, olives are not in the pizza because they are optional. We did not add them, so the pizza has no olives.

But why did dough, sauce, and cheese work even though we didn’t add them directly?<br />
That’s because they are required dependencies. When a container depends on others, `compose.up` _automatically includes required dependencies_, even if they are not specified.

Now let’s see how to include olives.

## Including Olives

To include olives, you just need to add them to `compose.up`.

```diff
const { up } = await compose({
-  stages: [['prepare', [pizza]]],
+  stages: [['prepare', [pizza, olives]]],
});
```

When you run this code, you should see the following output in the console:

```sh
olives + dough + sauce + cheese = pizza
```

## What’s Next?

So far, we’ve learned how to connect containers using dependencies and optional dependencies. This makes sure containers start when they need other containers.

But sometimes this is not enough.<br />
Imagine you’re making a pizza. You have dough and sauce, and you usually add cheese. But today, you look in the fridge and see — there is no cheese.

This is where `enable` helps. It lets you choose if a container should start, like checking if you have cheese before making the pizza.
