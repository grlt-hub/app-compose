In this section, we will create a simple container using `createContainer` and run it with `compose.up`. This example will show how to start using the library and understand its basic ideas.

The container we create will have an identifier, domain, and a start function that runs when the container starts. We will also see how `compose.up` connects containers and controls their execution.

## Analogy from Cooking

Imagine you are in a kitchen. You have a chef, ingredients, and a pot. Each of them is a container.

A chef alone can’t cook without ingredients. Ingredients won’t turn into a meal without a pot.

Containers don’t do much on their own, but when they work together, you get a finished meal. `compose.up` is the one that organizes the process, makes sure everything happens in the right order, and starts each part at the right time.

## Example

```ts
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const hireChef = () => null;

const chef = createContainer({
  // The name of our chef.
  id: 'John Doe',
  // This chef specializes in Italian cuisine.
  domain: 'italian-chef',
  start: async () => {
    // For example, we are hiring a chef.
    const hiredChef = await hireChef();

    console.log('The chef is already on the way!');

    // Every start function should return an object like this:
    // { api: object | null }
    return { api: hiredChef };
  },
});

const { up } = await compose({
  stages: [['prepare', [chef]]],
});
```

When you run this code, you should see the following output in the console:

```sh
The chef is already on the way!
```

## What’s Next?

In this example, we created a simple container that works alone. But in real applications, containers often depend on other containers to do their job.

Next, we will learn about `dependencies` and `optionalDependencies`. You’ll see how to connect containers and build flexible applications where different parts work together.
