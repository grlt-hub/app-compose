In this section, we will create a simple container using `createContainer` and run it with `compose.up`. This example will show you how to quickly get started with the library and understand its basic principles.

The container we create will include an identifier and an `onStart` function that runs upon initialization. You will see how `compose.up` brings containers together and manages their execution.

## Example

Here’s a basic example of creating and running a container.

```ts
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const user = createContainer({
  id: 'user', // Each container's id must be unique to avoid conflicts
  onStart: () => {
    console.log('User container started');
    return { api: null };
  },
});

compose.up([user]);
```

> Note: Every container's start function should return an object in the format `{ api: object | null }`. This structure helps standardize how data is provided to other containers that depend on it.

## Expected Result

When you run this code, you should see the following output in the console:

```sh
User container started
```

## Summary

In this example, we demonstrated how to create a simple container with `createContainer` and initialize it with `compose.up`. This provides a foundation for working with containers and managing execution in your application. In the following sections, we’ll explore more advanced usage and features, including handling dependencies and managing asynchronous operations.
