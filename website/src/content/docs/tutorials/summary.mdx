We have learned the basics of `app-compose`:

- Containers and how to create them.
- Dependencies and optional dependencies to connect containers.
- `enable` to control when a container should start.
- Stages to manage the order of container startup.

With these tools, you can build flexible and organized applications. Next, you can explore advanced features and best practices to make your project even stronger.
