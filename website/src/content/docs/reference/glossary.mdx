Below you will find short definitions of important `app-compose` terms. Understanding these terms will help you set up containers, manage dependencies, and control the flow of your application.

## Container

A container is a main part of your app. It is like a building block for your app.

### id

An ID is a unique name for the containe

### domain

A domain is a category for a container. It helps you put containers in logical groups (for example, ingredients or dish).

### dependencies

Dependencies are containers that must start before this container can run.<br />
They are requiredâ€”if one is missing, your container will not start.

### optionalDependencies

optionalDependencies are containers that the container can use if they are available.<br />
They are not required, so your container can still run without them.

### api

The object returned by container start. It can have data or methods that other containers use.<br />
An object like `{ api: {...} | null }`

### start

The start function runs when the container begins.<br />
It can use the APIs and statuses of container dependencies.

### enable

enable is a function that decides if the container can start.<br />
It can use the APIs and statuses of container dependencies.

## Compose

compose is a function that collects all containers and prepares them to run.<br />
It returns an object with methods like up for starting the containers.

### stages

Stages are steps for starting containers in priority.<br />
Each stage has a name and a list of containers.<br />
The containers in the first stage start first, then the next stage, and so on.

### up

A command that starts all containers in the correct order.

### graph

A command that displays how containers connect to each other.

### diff

A command that shows which containers started and which were skipped or added automatically.
