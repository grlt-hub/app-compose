`compose.up` is the primary function used to initialize list of containers, ensuring they are set up in the correct order based on their dependencies. This function manages the execution flow and provides optional debugging output.

## Syntax

```ts
compose.up(containers: Container[], config?: { debug?: boolean, apis?: boolean }): Promise<{
  hasErrors: boolean;
  statuses: Record<Container['id'], Container['status']>;
}>
```

## Parameters

- **containers** (`Container[]`): An array of containers to initialize. Each container in the array is processed based on its dependencies (`dependsOn` and `optionalDependsOn`), regardless of the order in which it appears.
- **config** (optional, `{ debug?: boolean, apis?: boolean, autoResolveDeps?: { strict: true, optional?: boolean } }`): An optional configuration object with the following properties:
  - **debug** (`boolean`): If `true`, `compose.up` will output detailed status updates to the console each time a containerâ€™s status changes. This is useful for tracking initialization and troubleshooting dependency issues.
  - **apis** (`boolean`): If set to `true`, the returned result from `compose.up` will include an `apis` object. In this object, each key is the `id` of a container, and the corresponding value is the `api` from the container's `start` function. The keys in `apis` are always **optional** because, at the type level, we cannot determine if a container has transitioned to the `done` status.
  - **autoResolveDeps** (`{ strict: true, optional?: boolean }`): Allows automatic resolution of dependencies. If `strict` is set to `true`, all strict dependencies are resolved automatically. The `optional` property, if set to `true`, enables automatic resolution of optional dependencies as well, eliminating the need to manually pass them to `compose.up`.

## Return Value

`compose.up` returns a promise that resolves to an object with the following structure:

- **hasErrors** (`boolean`): Indicates whether any container encountered an error during initialization.
- **statuses** (`Record<Container['id'], Container['status']>`): An object that maps each container ID to its final status (`idle`, `pending`, `done`, `fail`, or `off`).
- **apis** (`Record<Container['id'], Container['api']>`): If `compose.up.config` set to `true`

## Example

```ts
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const userContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'user',
  start: async () => {
    return { api: { userId: 'user123' } };
  },
});

const settingsContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'settings',
  dependsOn: [userContainer],
  start: () => {
    return { api: { theme: 'dark' } };
  },
});

await compose.up([userContainer, settingsContainer], { debug: true });
```

### Expected Resolution Order

```sh
userContainer: idle
settingsContainer: idle
###
userContainer: pending
settingsContainer: idle
###
userContainer: done
settingsContainer: pending
###
userContainer: done
settingsContainer: done
```

## Notes

- `compose.up` automatically handles dependencies based on the configuration of each container.
- The function only begins each container when its required dependencies are fully initialized (`done` status).
