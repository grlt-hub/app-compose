`compose.up` is the primary function used to visualize the system composed of containers.

## Syntax

```ts
type Config = {
  autoResolveDeps?: {
    strict: true;
    optional?: boolean;
  };
}

compose.graph(containers: AnyContainer[], config?: Config): Record<AnyContainer['id'], {
  strict: AnyContainer['id'],
  optional: AnyContainer['id'],
  transitive: {
    strict: {id: AnyContainer['id'], path: string}[],
    optional: {id: AnyContainer['id'], path: string}[],
  }
}>
```

## Parameters

- **containers** (`Container[]`): An array of containers to visualize.
- **config** (optional, `{ autoResolveDeps?: { strict: true, optional?: boolean } }`): An optional configuration object with the following properties:
  - **autoResolveDeps** (`{ strict: true, optional?: boolean }`): Allows automatic resolution of dependencies. If `strict` is set to `true`, all strict dependencies are resolved automatically. The `optional` property, if set to `true`, enables automatic resolution of optional dependencies as well, eliminating the need to manually pass them to `compose.up`.

## Return Value

The output of `compose.graph` provides a detailed breakdown of each container:

- **Direct Dependencies**:
  - **Strict**: Lists containers that are `strict` dependencies of the current container.
  - **Optional**: Lists containers that are `optional` dependencies of the current container.
- **Transitive Dependencies**:
  - **Strict**: Lists containers that are `strict` dependencies, inherited through a chain of dependencies.
  - **Optional**: Lists containers that are `optional` dependencies, inherited through a chain of dependencies.
- **Transitive Dependency Paths**:
  - Each transitive dependency includes a path that describes how the dependency is reached, which is helpful for tracing and debugging.

## Rules for Classifying Dependencies

1. **Direct Dependencies**:

   - A dependency is considered **direct** if it is explicitly declared in the `dependsOn` or `optionalDependsOn` lists of a container.
   - Direct dependencies are categorized as:
     - **Strict**: If they are listed in `dependsOn`.
     - **Optional**: If they are listed in `optionalDependsOn`.

2. **Transitive Dependencies**:

   - A dependency is considered **transitive** if it is inherited through a chain of dependencies from another container, rather than being directly listed.
   - **Classification of Transitive Dependencies**:
     - If a dependency path begins from a **strict** direct dependency, all subsequent dependencies in the chain are also **strict**.
     - If a dependency path begins from an **optional** direct dependency, all subsequent dependencies in the chain are **optional**, regardless of their original type.

3. **Propagation of Dependency Type**:
   - The strictness of a transitive dependency is determined by the type of the initial direct dependency in the chain:
     - If the initial direct dependency is **strict**, the entire chain is considered **strict**.
     - If the initial direct dependency is **optional**, the entire chain is considered **optional**.

These rules ensures that the classification of dependencies is consistent and reflects both direct and inherited relationships in a system.
