## 2.0.2

### Changed

- reduce bundle size

## 2.0.1

### Fixed

- `graph` return value

## 2.0.0

Vault

### Added

- support for managing container execution order using `stages`.
- `diff` command to display which containers were automatically added and which ones were skipped.
- `domain` a required parameter in `createContainer`.
- `view: domain` to visualize the entire application graph at the domain level.
- `graph.dependsOn` command to quickly identify which containers a given container depends on, including transitive dependencies.
- `graph.requiredBy` command to quickly identify which containers depend on a given container, including transitive dependencies.
- the second argument of the `start` and `enable` functions contains information about whether the parent containers have been resolved.

### Changed

- all parent container APIs are wrapped into the first parameter in `start` and `enable` functions.
- automatic resolving of strict dependencies is enabled by default.
- renamed `dependsOn` to `dependencies`.
- renamed `optionalDependsOn` to `optionalDependencies`.
- renamed `onFail` to `onContainerFail`.
- the message format for the `debug: true` option.

## 1.4.0

### Added

- `onFail` option to `compose.up` config for handling container failures, allowing centralized error tracking and custom recovery actions.

## 1.3.0

### Added

```ts
autoResolveDeps?: {
  strict: true;
  optional?: boolean;
};
```

in the `compose.up` and `compose.graph` configs. `autoResolveDeps` allows automatic resolution of container dependencies (both strict and optional) without the need to manually pass them to `compose.up` and `compose.graph`.

## 1.2.0

### Added

- `apis: boolean` in the `compose.up` config for accessing your containers' APIs after execution.

## 1.1.0

### Added

- [the ability to visualize](https://grlt-hub.github.io/app-compose/how-to-guides/visualize-the-system/) the system composed of containers effectively (including transitive dependencies and their paths)

## 1.0.0

### Added

- `createContainer` fn
- `compose.up` fn
