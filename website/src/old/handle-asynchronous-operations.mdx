In this guide, we’ll explore how to manage asynchronous tasks within containers using `start`, `compose.up`, and `enable`. Whether loading data, performing API calls, or handling other asynchronous operations, this guide will cover:

- **Async functions in** `start`: Handling asynchronous tasks inside the `start` function.
- **Awaiting** `compose.up`: Using `await` with `compose.up` to ensure all containers complete their tasks before proceeding.
- **Asynchronou** `enable`: Setting up conditional starts with asynchronous checks in `enable`.

With these techniques, you can create asynchronous flows that allow containers to fully initialize before advancing to the next steps.

## Examples

### Example 1: Using async Functions in `start`

For containers that need to perform asynchronous operations, `start` can be defined as an `async` function. Here’s an example where `start` fetches data from an API:

```ts {5}
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const userContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'user',
  start: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user');
    const userData = await response.json();
    console.log('User data loaded:', userData);
    return { api: { userData } };
  },
});

await compose.up([userContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

The `userContainer` will complete its initialization once `start` finishes fetching and processing data:

```sh
User data loaded: { ... }
```

### Example 2: Asynchronous `enable`

The `enable` function can also handle asynchronous conditions by returning a promise. This allows you to delay container initialization until specific conditions are met based on asynchronous checks.

```ts {5}
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const restrictedFeatureContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'restrictedFeature',
  enable: async (depsApi) => {
    const permissions = await response.json();
    if (permissions.includes('access_restricted_feature')) {
      console.log('Permission exists');
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  },
  start: () => {
    console.log('Restricted feature started');
    return { api: {} };
  },
});

await compose.up([restrictedFeatureContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

If `permissions` loads and includes access permissions, `restrictedFeatureContainer` will start:

```sh
Permission exists
Restricted feature started
```

If the `permissions` do not grant access, `restrictedFeatureContainer` will remain `off`.

### Example 3: Awaiting compose.up

When working with multiple containers, you might want to wait until all containers complete their `start` or `enable` tasks. Since `compose.up` returns a `promise`, you can `await` it to ensure that all containers have finished their initialization.

```ts {19}
const configContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'config',
  start: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/config');
    const configData = await response.json();
    console.log('Config loaded:', configData);
    return { api: { configData } };
  },
});

const settingsContainer = createContainer({
  id: 'settings',
  start: () => {
    console.log('Settings initialized');
    return { api: { theme: 'dark' } };
  },
});

await compose.up([configContainer, settingsContainer]);
```

#### Expected Result

Using `await compose.up`, you ensure that both `configContainer` and `settingsContainer` have completed before proceeding:

```sh
Config loaded: { ... }
Settings initialized
```

## Summary

In this guide, we covered how to handle asynchronous operations in containers:

- **Async** `start`: Allows containers to complete tasks such as data fetching.
- **Async** `enable`: Lets you conditionally `start` containers based on asynchronous checks.
- **Awaiting** `compose.up`: Ensures all containers complete before moving on.

By using `start` and `enable` in combination with `compose.up`, you can manage asynchronous flows effectively, ensuring each container fully initializes before proceeding and creating reliable, sequential workflows.
