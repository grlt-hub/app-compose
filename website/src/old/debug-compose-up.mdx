When working with multiple containers, it can be helpful to track their statuses in real time. The `compose.up` function provides a built-in debugging option, which outputs status updates for each container to the console whenever a change occurs. In this guide, we’ll explore:

- **Using the** `debug` **option**: How to enable detailed logging for container statuses.
- **Interpreting Status Messages**: Understanding the format of status updates in the console.

This feature is especially useful when troubleshooting dependencies and monitoring the initialization sequence of containers.

## Enabling Debugging with `debug: true`

The `compose.up` function accepts an optional second argument, a configuration object, which can include `debug`. When `debug: true` is set, `compose.up` will output each container's status as it changes. Here’s how to enable debugging:

```ts {9}
import { createContainer, compose } from '@grlt-hub/app-compose';

const start: () => { api: {} };

const containerA = createContainer({ id: 'a', start });
const containerB = createContainer({ id: 'b', start, enable: () => false });
const containerC = createContainer({ id: 'c', start });

await compose.up([containerA, containerB, containerC], { debug: true });
```

With `debug: true`, the console will display status messages each time a container's status changes.

### Example Output

Here’s an example of what you might see in the console when debugging is enabled:

```sh
[2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z] app-compose:
{
  "a": "done",
  "b": "off",
  "c": "done"
}
```

In this example:

- Each line displays a timestamp, followed by the statuses of each container.
- The statuses show which containers are `done`, `off`, or in another state at any given time.

## Benefits of Debugging

The debug option helps you:

- **Identify Initialization Order**: Understand the sequence in which containers complete.
- **Monitor Dependencies**: Ensure that containers with dependencies wait for the correct statuses before initializing.
- **Diagnose Issues**: Quickly spot any containers stuck in unexpected statuses, such as `off` or `fail`.

## Summary

In this guide, we explored how to use the `debug` option in `compose.up` to monitor container statuses in real time:

- **Enabling Debugging**: Setting `{ debug: true }` in the `compose.up` configuration outputs status updates to the console whenever a container’s status changes.
- **Interpreting Status Messages**: The console log provides a timestamped snapshot of each container’s current status, helping to track progress and identify issues.

Using the `debug` option offers valuable insights into the initialization process, allowing you to verify dependency order, monitor container progress, and troubleshoot unexpected statuses with ease.
